The `odesolvers` package contains tools for solving ordinary
differential equations (ODEs). The user specifies the problem through
high-level Python code. Both scalar ODEs and systems of ODEs are
supported.  A wide range of numerical methods for ODEs are offered.


======= Basic Usage =======

===== Overview =====

The typical usage of the tools consists of six steps. These are
outlined in generic form below.

=== Step 1 ===

Write the ODE problem on the generic form $u' = f(u, t)$,
where $u(t)$ is the unknown function to be solved for, or a vector
of unknown functions of time in case of a system of ODEs.

=== Step 2 ===

Implement the right-hand side function $f(u, t)$, which
defines the ODEs to be solved, as a Python function `f(u, t)`.  The
argument `u` is either a `float` object (in case of a scalar ODE) or a
`numpy` array object (in case of a system of ODEs).  Alternatively, a
class with a `__call__` method can be used instead of a plain
function.  Some tools in this package also allow implementation of $f$
in Fortran or C for increased efficiency.

=== Step 3 ===

Create a method object
!bc pycod
method = classname(f)
!ec
where `classname` is the name of a class in this package implementing
the desired numerical method.

Many solver classes has a range of parameters that the user can set to
control various parts of the solution process. The parameters are
documented in the doc string of the class (`pydoc classname` will list
the documentation in a terminal window). One can either specify parameters
at construction time, via extra keyword arguments to the constructor,
!bc pycod
method = classname(f, prm1=value1, prm2=value2, ...)
!ec
or at any time using the `set` method:
!bc pycod
method.set(prm1=value1, prm2=value2, prm3=value3)
...
method.set(prm4=value4)
!ec

=== Step 4 ===

Set the initial condition, $u(0)=U_0$,
!bc pycod
method.set_initial_condition(U0)
!ec
where `U0` is either a number, for a scalar ODE, or a sequence (list, tuple,
`numpy` array), for a system of ODEs.

=== Step 5 ===

Solve the ODE problem, which means to compute $u(t)$ at
some discrete user-specified time points $t_i$, for
$i=0,1,\ldots,n$|$i=0,1,...,n$.
!bc pycod
T = ...  # end time
time_points = numpy.linspace(0, T, n+1)
u, t = method.solve(time_points)
!ec
In case of a scalar ODE, the returned solution `u` is a one-dimensional
`numpy` array where `u[i]` holds the solution at time point `t[i]`.
For a system of ODEs, the returned `u` is a two-dimensional `numpy`
array where `u[i,j]` holds the solution of the $j$-th unknown
function at the $i$-th time point `t[i]` ($u_j(t_i)$ in mathematics
notation).

The `time_points` array specifies the time points where we want the
solution to be computed. The returned array `t` is the same as
`time_points`.  The simplest numerical methods in the `odesolvers`
package apply the `time_points` array directly in the solution. That
is, the time steps used are given by `time_points[i] -
time_points[i-1]`, for `i=0,1,...,len(time_points)-1`.  Some more
advanced adaptive methods compute the time steps internally. Then the
`time_points` array is just a specification of the time points where
we want to know the solution.

[hpl: Need to document how the tp array is used.]

[hpl: Need to comment on storage.]

The `solve` method in solver classes also allows a second argument,
`terminate`, which is a user-implemented Python function specifying
when the solution process is to be terminated. For example,
terminating when the solution reaches an asymptotic (known) value
`a` can be done by
!bc pycod
def terminate(u, t, step_no):
    # u and t are arrays. Most recent solution is u[step_no].
    tolerance = 1E-6
    return True if abs(u[step_no] - a) < tolerance else False

u, t = method.solve(time_points, terminate)
!ec
The arguments transferred to the `terminate` function are the
solution array `u`, the corresponding time points `t`, and
an integer `step_no` reflecting the most recently computed `u`
value. That is, `u[step_no]` is most recently computed value of $u$.
(The array data `u[step_no+1:]` will typically be zero as these
are uncomputed future values.)


=== Step 6 ===

Extract solution components for plotting and further analysis.
Since the `u` array returned from `method.solve` stores all unknown
functions at all discrete time levels, one usually wants to extract
individual unknowns as one-dimensional arrays. Here is an example
where unknown $0$ and $k$ are extracted in individual arrays and plotted:
!bc pycod
u_0 = u[:,0]
u_k = u[:,k]

from matplotlib.pyplot import plot, show
plot(t, u_0, t, u_k)
show()
!ec

===== Example: Exponential Growth =====
label{ode:sec:exgr}

Our first example concerns the simple scalar ODE problem $u'=cu$,
$u(0)=A$, where $A>0$ and $c>0$ are known constants. Using a standard
Runge-Kutta method of order four, the code for solving the problem in
the time interval $[0,10]$, with $N=30$ time steps, looks like this:

@@@CODE src-tut/exgr1.py  fromto: c = @

With the `RK4` method and other non-adaptive methods
the time steps are dictated by the `time_points` array.
A constant time step of size `time_points[1] - time_points[0] = 1/3`
is implied in the present example.


=== Parameters in the Right-Hand Side Function ===
label{ode:sec:exgr:farg}

The right-hand side function and all physical parameters are often
lumped together in a class, for instance,

@@@CODE src-tut/exgr2.py  fromto: class Exponential@import numpy

We may also compare the numerical and exact solution:

@@@CODE src-tut/exgr2.py  fromto: u_exact = @

Instead of having the `c` variable as a global variable or
in a class, we may include it as an extra argument to `f`, either
as a positional argument or as a keyword argument. Positional arguments
can be sent to `f` via the constructor argument `f_args` (a list/tuple of
variables), while a dictionary `f_kwargs` is used to transfer
keyword arguments to `f` via the constructor:

@@@CODE src-tut/exgr3.py  fromto: \# f has extra@method\.set_initial

The right-hand side function `f` may feature both extra positional
arguments and extra keyword arguments,
!bc pycod
def f(u, t, arg1, arg2, arg3, ..., kwarg1=val1, kwarg2=val2, ...):
    ...

method = odesolvers.classname(f,
                    f_args=[arg1, arg2, arg3, ...],
                    f_kwargs=dict(kwarg1=val1, kwarg2=val2, ...))

# Alternative setting of f_args and f_kwargs
method.set(f_args=[arg1, arg2, arg3, ...],
           f_kwargs=dict(kwarg1=val1, kwarg2=val2, ...))
!ec
Solvers will call `f` as `f(u, t, *f_args, **f_kwargs)`.

=== Continuing a Previous Simulation ===

It is easy to simulate for some time interval $[0, T_1]$,
the continue with $u(T_1)$ as new initial condition and simulate for
$t$ in $[T_1, T_2]$ and so on. Let us divide the time
domain $[0,10]$ into subdomains and compute the solution for
each subdomain in sequence. The following program performs the steps.

@@@CODE src-tut/exgr4.py  fromto:c = 0.1@


===== Example: Decay Equation =====

The second example also concerns the ODE $u'=cu$, but this time with
$c<0$. We want to integrate until the asymptotic value $u=0$ is
reached with an accuracy of $0.001$. For this purpose we need a
`terminate` function, which returns `True` when the termination
criterion is met:

@@@CODE src-tut/exde1.py  tol =@u, t =

The complete program may take the form

@@@CODE src-tut/exde1.py  fromto: c = -@

Note that the size of the returned arrays `u` and `t` fits
the time interval up to the point of termination by `terminate`.


===== Example: Decay Equation with Other Symbols =====

The `odesolvers` package applies `u` for the unknown function or
vector of unknown functions and `t` as the name of the independent
variable. Many problems involve other symbols for functions and
independent variables. These symbols should be reflected in the code.
For example, here is a coding example involving the differential
equation $y'(x)=-y(x)$, $y(0)=1$:

@@@CODE src-tut/exde2.py  fromto: def myrhs@

As shown, we use `y` for `u`, `x` for `t`, and `x_points` instead
of `time_points`.

===== Example: The Pendulum Equation =====

The angle $\theta$|$theta$ of a pendulum with mass $m$ and length $L$
is governed by the equation
(neglecting air resistance for simplicity)
# #if FORMAT == "latex" or FORMAT == "sphinx"
!bt
\[
mL\ddot\theta + mg\sin\theta = 0,\quad \theta (0)=\Theta,\
\dot\theta (0)=0 .
\]
!et
A dot over $\theta$ implies differentiation with respect to time.
The ODE can be written as $\ddot\theta + c\sin\theta=0$ by
introducing $c = g/L$.
# #else
# pure ASCII
_theta'' + c*sin(theta) = 0_, with _theta(0) = Theta_ and _theta'(0) = 0_.
# #endif
This problem must be expressed as a first-order ODE system if it is
going to be solved by the tools in the `odesolvers` package.
# #if FORMAT == "latex" or FORMAT == "sphinx"
Introducing $\omega = \dot\theta$ (the angular velocity) as auxiliary
unknown, we get the system
!bt
\begin{align*}
\dot\theta &= \omega,\\
\dot\omega &= -c\sin\theta,
\end{align*}
!et
with $\theta(0)=\Theta$ and $\omega(0)=0$.
# #else
Introducing omega as theta', we get the first equation as
_theta' = omega_ and the second as _omega' = -c*sin(theta)_.
The initial conditions are _theta(0) = Theta_ and _omega'(0) = 0_.
# #endif

Now the `f` function must return a list or array with the two
right-hand side functions:

@@@CODE src-tut/exos1.py  fromto: def f@method =

Note that when we have a system of ODEs with `n` components, the `u`
object sent to the `f` function is an array of length `n`,
representing the value of all components in the ODE system at time `t`.
Here we extract the two components of `u` in separate local variables
with names equal to what is used in the mathematical description of
the current problem.

The initial conditions must be specified as a list:

@@@CODE src-tut/exos1.py  fromto: method =@freq =

To specify the time points we here first decide on a number of periods
(oscillations back and forth) to simulate and then on the time resolution
of each period. (When $\Theta$|$Theta$ is small we can replace
$\sin\theta$|$sin(theta)$ by $\theta$|$theta$ and find an analytical
solution
$\theta (t)=\Theta\cos\left(\sqrt{c}t\right)$|$theta(t) = Theta*cos(sqrt(c)*t)$
whose period is $2\pi/\sqrt{c}$|$2*pi/sqrt(c)$.)

@@@CODE src-tut/exos1.py  fromto: freq =@theta =

The `u` returned from `method.solve` is a two-dimensional array, where the
columns hold the various solution functions of the ODE system. That is,
the first column holds $\theta$|$theta$ and the second column holds
$\omega$|$omega$. For convenience we extract the individual solution
components in individual arrays:

@@@CODE src-tut/exos1.py  fromto: theta =@import matplotlib

===== Example: Testing Several Methods =====

We shall now make a more advanced solver by
extending the previous example. More specifically, we shall

  * represent the right-hand side function as class,
  * compare several different solvers,
  * compute error of numerical solutions.

Since we want to compare numerical errors in the various
solvers we need a test problem where the exact solution is known.
Approximating $\sin(\theta)$|$sin(theta)$ by $\theta$|$theta$
(valid for small $\theta$|$theta$), gives the ODE system
# #if FORMAT == "latex" or FORMAT == "sphinx"
!bt
\begin{align*}
\dot\theta &= \omega,\\
\dot\omega &= -c\theta,
\end{align*}
!et
with $\theta(0)=\Theta$ and $\omega(0)=0$.
# #else
_theta' = omega_ and _omega' = -c*theta_ with
initial conditions _theta(0) = Theta_ and _omega'(0) = 0_.
# #endif

Right-hand side functions with parameters can be handled by
including extra arguments via the `f_args` and `f_kwargs` functionality,
or by using a class where the parameters are attributes and
a `__call__` method makes the class instance callable as a function.
Section ref{ode:sec:exgr:farg} exemplifies the details.
A minimal class representation of the right-hand side
function in the present case looks like this:
!bc
class Problem:
    def __init__(self, c, Theta):
        self.c, self.Theta = float(c), float(Theta)

    def __call__(self, u, t):
        theta, omega = u;  c = self.c
        return [omega, -c*theta]

problem = Problem(c=1, Theta=pi/4)
!ec
It would be convenient to add an attribute `period` which holds
an estimate of the period of oscillations as we need this for
deciding on the complete time interval for solving the differential
equations. An appropriate extension of class `Problem` is therefore

@@@CODE src-tut/exos2.py  fromto: class Problem@import odesolvers

The second extension is to loop over many solvers. All
solvers can be listed by
!bc ipy
>>> import odesolvers, pprint
>>> solvers = list_all_solvers()
>>> for solver in solvers:
...   print solver

A similar function, `list_available_solvers`, returns a list of the
names of the solvers that are available in the current installation
(e.g., the `Vode` solver is only available if the comprehensive
`scipy` package is installed).
This is the list that is usually most relevant.

For now we explicitly choose a subset of the commonly available solvers:

@@@CODE src-tut/exos2.py  fromto: import odesolvers@N_per_period =

It will be evident that the `ThetaRule` solver with `theta=0` and
`theta=1` (Forward and Backward Euler methods) gives growing and
decaying amplitudes, respectively, while the other solvers are
capable of reproducing the constant amplitude of the oscillations of
in the current mathematical model.

The loop over the chosen solvers may look like

@@@CODE src-tut/exos2.py  fromto: N_per_period =@

FIGURE: [src-tut/exos2.png, width=500] Comparison of solutions.

We can extend this program to compute the error in each numerical
solution for different time step sizes.
Let `results` be a dictionary with the method name as
key, containing two sub dictionaries `dt` and `error`, which hold
a sequence of time steps and a sequence of corresponding
errors, respectively. The errors are computed by subtracting
the numerical solution from the exact solution,
!bc pycod
theta_exact = lambda t: problem.Theta*numpy.cos(sqrt(problem.c)*t)
u, t = method.solve(time_points)
theta = u[:,0]
error = numpy.abs(theta_exact(t) - theta)
!ec
The so-called L2 norm of the `error` array is a suitable
scalar error measure (square root of total error squared and integrated,
here numerically):
!bc pycod
error_L2 = sqrt(numpy.sum(error**2)/dt)
!ec
where `dt` is the time step size.

Typical loops over solvers and resolutions look as follows:

@@@CODE src-tut/exos3.py  fromto: T = num_periods@\# Print

Assuming the error to be of the form $C\Delta t^r$, we can estimate
$C$ and $r$ from two consequtive experiments to obtain a sequence
of $r$ values which (hopefully) convergences to a value that we can
view as the empirical convergence rate of a method.
Given the sequence of time steps and errors, a function in
the `scitools` package automatically computes the sequence of
$r$ values:

@@@CODE src-tut/exos3.py  fromto: \# Analyze@

With 4 periods we get
!bc dat
ThetaRule(theta=0)   r: 2.9, 1.9, 1.4, 1.2 E_min=1.1E-01
RK2          r: 2.1, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0 E_min=8.4E-04
ThetaRule(theta=1)   r: 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8 E_min=9.0E-02
RK4          r: 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0 E_min=2.6E-08
ThetaRule            r: 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0 E_min=4.2E-04
Leapfrog             r: 2.1, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0 E_min=8.5E-04
LeapfrogFiltered     r: 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 E_min=1.3E-01
!ec
The rates of the Forward and Backward Euler methods (1st and 3rd line) have
not yet converged to unity, as expected, while the 2nd-order
Runge-Kutta method, Leapfrog, and the $\theta$|$theta$-rule with $\theta =0.5$
(`ThetaRule` with default value of `theta`) shows the expected
$r=2$ value. The 4th-order Runge-Kutta holds the promise of being of 4th
order, while the filtered Leapfrog method has slow convergence and
a fairly large error, which is also evident in the previous figure.

Extending the time domain to 20 periods makes many of the
simplest methods inaccurate:
!bc dat
ThetaRule(theta=0)   r: 10.4, 22.0, 18.2, 10.4 E_min=3.3E+02
RK2          r: 51.4, 16.1, 2.3, 2.1 E_min=1.1E-01
ThetaRule(theta=1)   r: 11.2, 0.0, 0.1 E_min=5.0E-01
RK4          r: 1.0, 3.6, 4.0, 4.0 E_min=8.2E-05
ThetaRule            r: 87.8, 0.2, 1.7, 2.0 E_min=5.3E-02
Leapfrog             r: 95.9, 18.0, 1.0, 2.0 E_min=1.1E-01
LeapfrogFiltered     r: -0.0, 121.2, 0.3, 0.1 E_min=5.2E-01
!ec


======= Inner Workings of the Package =======

The solvers are organized as classes in a class hierarchy with class
`Solver` as superclass. Each class is initialized by the right-hand
side function (`f`) and an optional set of parameters for controlling
various parts of the solution process. Below we describe how the
superclass and its subclasses work and how parameters are registered
and initialized.

===== Solver Parameters =====

The `ODE` module defines a global dictionary `_parameters` holding
all legal parameters. Other modules imports this `_parameters` dict
and updates it with their own additional parameters.

For each parameter the `_parameters` dict stores the parameter name, a
default value, a description, the legal object type for the value of
the parameter, and other quantities if needed. A typical example
is
!bc
_parameters = dict(
...

f = dict(
    help='Right-hand side f(u,t) defining the ODE',
    type=callable),

f_kwargs = dict(
    help='Extra keyword arguments to f: f(u, t, *f_args, **f_kwargs)',
    type=dict,
    default={}),

theta = dict(
    help="""Weight in [0,1] used for
"theta-rule" finite difference approx.""",
    default=0.5,
    type=(int,float),
    range=[0, 1])

...
}
!ec

Each solver class defines a (static) class variable
`_required_parameters` for holding the names of all required
parameters (in a list). In addition, each solver class defines another
class variable `_optional_parameters` holding the names of all the
optional parameters. The doc strings of the solver classes are
automatically equipped with tables of required and optional
parameters.

The optional parameters of a class consists of the optional parameters
of the superclass and those specific to the class. The typical
initialization of `_optional_parameters` goes like this:
!bc pycod
class SomeMethod(ParentMethod):
    _optional_parameters = ParentMethod._optional_parameters + \
                           ['prm1', 'prm2', ...]
!ec
where `prm1`, `prm2`, etc. are names registered in the global
`_parameters` dictionary.

From a user's point of view, the parameters are set either at
construction time or through the `set` function:
!bc py
>>> from odesolvers import RK2
>>> def f(u, t, a, b=0):
...   return a*u + b
...
>>> method = RK2(f, f_kwargs=dict(b=1))
>>> method.f_kwargs
{'b': 1}
>>> method.set(f_args=(3,))
>>> method.f_args
(3,)
>>> # Get all registered parameters in the method instance
>>> method.get()
{'f_kwargs': {'b': 1}, 'f_args': (3,), 'complex_valued': False,
'name of f': 'f'}
!ec
The `set` method sets parameters through keyword arguments and can
take an arbitrary collection of such arguments:
!bc cod
method.set(name1=value1, name2=value2, name3=value3, ...)
!ec

The `get` method returns the parameters and their values as a dictionary.
(Note that the `'f'` key, which one might expect to appear in the
returned dictionary of parameters, are omitted because it is always
a lambda function wrapping the user's `f` function such that the
returned value is guaranteed to be a `numpy` array. Instead,
there is an entry `'name of f'` which reflects the name of the
user-supplied function.)


===== Solver Classes =====

Each solver in this package is implemented as a class in a class hierarchy.
Basic, common functionality is inherited from super classes, and the
actual solver class implements what is specific for the method in question.

Class `Solver` is the super class of the hierarchy. Its constructor
requires one mandatory argument: the right-hand side of the ODE,
$f(u,t)$, coded as a Python function `f(u, t)` or given as a string
containing code in a compiled language (Fortran, for instance)
implementing the right-hand side.  Additional keyword arguments can be
provided to set parameters of the solver.

The constructor performs a set of tasks that are common to all
the subclass solvers:

 o The set of optional and required parameters of a particular solver
   is loaded into `self._parameters` such that this dictionary
   can be used to look up all parameters of the solver.

 o Representation of $f(u, t)$ (or the Jacobian) in a compiled language
   is compiled into an extension module.

 o The solver-specific method `adjust_parameters` is called to allow
   the programmer of a solver to manipulate `self._parameters`.
   For example, some existing or new parameters may be modified or set
   according to the value of other parameters.

 o All key-value pairs in `self._parameters` are mirrored by class
   attributes. The computations and the `set` and `get` methods will
   make use of the attributes rather than the `self._parameters` dict
   to extract data.  For example, the value of
   `self._parameters['myvar']` becomes available as `self.myvar` and
   in the algorithms we use `self.myvar`, perhaps with a test
   `hasattr(self, 'myvar')` test or a `try`-`except` clause (catching
   an `AttributeError`).

 o The `set` method is called with all keyword arguments to the
   constructor, which then modifies the default values of the
   parameters.

 o The `f` function is wrapped in a lambda function such that
   `f(u, t)` is guaranteed to return an array (in case the user
   returns a list or scalar for convenience).

 o The `initialize` method is called to finalize the tasks in
   the constructor. The most common use of this method in subclasses
   is to import extension modules that the solver depends on and
   provide an error message if the extension modules are not available.
   If they are, the modules are normally stored through an attribute
   of the subclass.

Let `method` some instance of a subclass in the hierarchy. The
following calls are possible (through inheriting common convenience
methods in the super class `Solver`):

 * `repr(method)`: return the subclass name along with all
   registered parameters and their values. This string provides
   complete information on the state of a subclass.

 * `str(method)`: return a short pretty print string reflecting
   the name of the method and the value of parameters that
   must be known to uniquely define the numerical method.
   This string is what one would use as legends in a plot or
   as method identifier in a table.

 * `method.get_parameter_info`: return or print all registered
   parameters for the current solver and all properties for
   each parameter.

After the constructor is called, `method.set_initial_condition` is
called to set the initial condition, and then `solve` is called.
The `solve` method features the following steps:

 o Convert `time_points` to a `numpy` array.
 o Call `initial_for_solve` (implemented in subclasses) to
   precompute whatever is needed before the time loop.
   The super class allocates storage for the solution and
   loads the initial condition into that data structure.
 o Run a loop over all time levels `n` and call `advance` (implemented
   in subclasses) at each level to advance the solution from
   time `t[n]` to `t[n+1]`. Also call `terminate` so that the
   user code can analyze and work with the solution.

Some subclasses will override the `solve` method and provide their own,
but most subclasses just inherits the general one and implement
the `advance` method.

All classes have a set of attributes:

 o `users_f` holding the user's function for $f(u, t)$
   (implicit solvers will have a corresponding `users_jac` for
   the user's Jacobian),
 o one attribute for each parameter in the class,
 o `u`: 1D `numpy` array holding the solution for a scalar ODE and
   a 2D array in case of a system of ODEs. The first index
   denotes the time level.
 o `t`: the time levels corresponding to the first index in the `u` array.

# Explain a subclass, show example

======= Installation =======

The `odesolvers` package is most easily installed by checkout out
the latest version of the source code:
!bc sys
git clone git@github.com:hplgit/odesolvers.git
cd odesolvers
!ec
The installation follows the expected standard procedure,
!bc sys
sudo python setup.py install
!ec

The `odesolvers` package depends on several other packages:

 * `scipy` for running the `Vode` Adams/BDF solver and the
   Dormand-Prince adaptive methods `Dop853`, and `Dopri5`.
 * `sympy` for running the extremely accurate `SymPy_odefun` solver.

These packages are readily downloaded and installed by the
standard `setup.py` script as shown above.
On Ubuntu and other Debian-based Linux systems the following

sudo apt-get install python-scipy python-nose python-sympy
!ec

======= TODO =======

 * Start tutorial with solving a real problem with vode and RK2 say;
   preferably some system where it is unclear if a sophisticated or
   standard method will work.
 * new parameter: casename, put in Solver, always have, but can be None
 * Incorporate odelab
 * Interface sundials
 * Show phase space plot
 * call scipy.optimize.fsolve for Newton?
 * Show how to store different simulations in file (shelve, Gael's
   work, NumPyDB), name each case, could have solve(..., storage='file')
   and then return u as some file-like object that accepts u[i] etc and
   for ui in u etc. Could be easy in class Solver. Requires param filename.
 * Design overview with superclasses
 * Storage (and philosophy)
 * SIR examples
 * Physics examples where class Problem has kinetic energy(u),
   potential energy(u), position, momentum, velocity, friction force,
   spring force, etc. Given u, get the physical quantity.
   Could be a general base class for Oscillators,
   odesolvers.Problem.Oscillator.
 * Complete physics example with class Problem, Solver and Viz a la INF1100.
   Adaptive error controlled solution.
 * Solvers for 2nd order eqs where f must be an object and also have a
   method d2ut2(u, dudt, t) for returning u''="f"?
 * PDE examples: conservation laws, diffusion
 * SODEs, need f as f + noise(u, t)? Problem: need dt, otherwise we
   could do this without any support. Solution: provide dt to
   f constructor :-)
 * Explain and show the code of the hierarchy.
